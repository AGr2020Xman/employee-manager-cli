# Employee Tracker CLI

![badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-mit-green.svg)<br />

## Description

Developers are often tasked with creating interfaces that make it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases. Often these interfaces are known as **C**ontent **M**anagement **S**ystems.

I've been challenged to architect and build a solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL. This has been achieved to the best of my abilities in the below application, allowing a user to interact with an employee tracking database. It allows the viewing, adding, deleting and updating for data in a clear easy to follow CLI.
